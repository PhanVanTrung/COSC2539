0/ remove all characters before '>' and after '<' inclusive.
1/ create CountFrequency function (pass two arguments: first argument is input file - cipher text file, and the second is frequency output file)
2/ create ReplaceChar function (pass two arguments: first argument is input file - cipher text file,  and the second is plain output file)
3/ looking at the result file from CountFrequency, use character-frequency technique to guess (in this case,most common character is the space character)
4/ solve munually, replace each character in the ReplaceChar function.
