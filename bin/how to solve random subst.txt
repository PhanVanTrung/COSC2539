1/ create count char frequency
2/ create ReplaceChar function
3/ use character-frequency technique to guess (in this case, most common character is the space)
4/ solve munually, guess char by char.


----- notice::::::::::: as I guessed, bcoz of the file format, there is always one character extra in my case, but that should not affect the technique, solution.
